Solving Sudoku Puzzles With Computer Vision And Neural Networks

**Solving Sudoku Puzzle Using Neural Network**

The **classic sudoku** is a number placing puzzle game with a grid of **9 rows and 9 columns**, partly filled with **numbers 1..9** . We have to fill up the remaining positions such that each **row, columns and 3x3 sub grids** contains numbers 1..9, **without repeatation**.

Here our **input** is an **image of sudoku** puzzle and we need to produce a corresponding **output image** by filling the remaining positions of the input. The pipeline for the **solution** consists of the following steps.

1. Preprocess the input image and remove the background
2. Crop ROI's containing digits from the grid
3. Predict numbers from image crops using neural network
4. Predict solution using neural network in an iterative manner
5. Verify the solution and plot the resuts on the input image

 We use **tensorflow-keras** library for training(prediction) the neural network and **opencv** library for image processing.
 The **input** sudoku puzzles are assumed to be **images** of printed version of the puzzle.
 ### Training Datasets
 
 The **digit recognition** model was trained using the entire **SVHN dataset**(train, test and extra) in grayscale mode. It is used to classify digits 0 to 9.
 The **sudoku solver** model was trained using a dataset of **10 million** puzzles. The inputs for this model contains **9x9 arrays** of integers representing the puzzles, such that **zeros** represent the **unfilled** positions.
 
 The **numpy dataset** used for training was created by combining the following **two datasets in csv** formats.
 
 1. [One Million Sudoku Puzzles](https://www.kaggle.com/bryanpark/sudoku)
 2. [Nine Million Sudoku Puzzles](https://www.kaggle.com/rohanrao/sudoku)
 
 ### Sudoku Solver Algorithm
 
 A **single iteration** of the model, as such does not seem to produce correct results for all the positions in the input.
 So, we follow a **iterative approach** of feeding the partial solution of one iteration as input to next iteration.
 
* The input is a sudoku matrix of 9x9 with numbers 0...9 as input(i.e 'puzzle').
* Zeros represents the blank spaces in the original puzzle.
* Each iteration produces an output array of 9x9 with numbers 1...9 (i.e 'out').
* For each such output array, 'maxp'(9x9) contains the corresponding probability values.
* For each filled(non-zero) element in input array we set corresponding probability in 'maxp' o -1.
* Now, find the maximum element(single) in 'maxp' and set the corresponding position of input with corresponding values from current output.
* Repeat the iterations with modified input(i.e 'puzzle'), until all elements are filled (ie. no zeros).

The algoritm takes N iterations for solving the entire puzzle, where N represenets the number of unfilled positions.

### Digit Recognition Inputs

* The input puzzle should be a **grayscale or rgb** image. 
* The images should **not be blurry or shaky**.
* It should be a **close-up** image of the puzzle from a **flat** surface.
* The puzzle should be in **printed format** eg.: paper or screen
* The puzzle image should not contain **marks, stains** or unnecessary patterns.
 
 ### Sudoku Models
 
1. **Digit Recognition**

The model was trained using **Adam optimizer** with a learning rate 0.001 ~ 0.000001 and **SCCE loss** function.

2. **Sudoku Solver**

A **heavy dense and heavy conv** model was trained using the the same dataset.
The following sections shows the overall **summary** of the model and their training results.

**a) Dense model**

The model was trained using **Adam optimizer** with a learning rate 0.001 ~ 0.000001 and **SCCE loss** function.
Here, most of the parameters are contributed by **dense layers** and conv layers are light weight.

**c) Recurrent Model**

The model was trained using **Adam optimizer** with a learning rate 0.001 and **MSE loss** function.
Here, there are **no conv layers** and it heavily uses dense layers. 

* The **inputs are one-hot-encoded** version of the puzzle **constraints** (row, column and block) and they have **varaible lengths**, proportional to number of unfilled positions. 
* During training, the model sequentially finds the **most probalble output digit** and feeds this partially filled puzzle to the next iteration in  a **recurrent** fashion.
* The **loss** is computed only after the **final step**, when all the remaining positions are filled.

### Testing Sudoku Solver Models

The test dataset consists of **30** puzzles from website: https://1sudoku.com and **30** random puzzles from **newspapers**. They mostly contain difficulties ranging from **easy to medium**. A puzzle is considered to be solved only if **all its elements are predicted correctly** . All of the models were trained using the same dataset.

| Model Type     |  Performance |
| -------------- | --------- |
| Dense Model |       40/60 |
| Conv Model |      50/60 |
| Recurrent Model |  25/60 |  

### Drawbacks and Limitations

* Even though the **dense model** has faster convergance and lower training time, it is **not able to generalize** well on test datasets.
* The **recurrent model** easily learns the puzzles from a small and easy training dataset; but it is **unable to handle difficult or medium difficulty puzzles**.
* Training the **recurrent model** on a large dataset consumes a lot of **time** and resource.
* In comparison to other models, the **conv model** is able to predict and **generalize well** on test datasets, after being trained on the same training set. On the flip side, this model is **heavier** than other models in terms of parameters and other resource usage.
* The original **dataset** mostly contains **easy/medium difficulty** puzzles, with an average of **47 unfilled**(zero) elements or 34 filled numbers(clues).
* **None of the  models** seems to **converge** on training with a [sudoku dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/radcliffe/3-million-sudoku-puzzles-with-ratings) containing **hard puzzles** (57 average unfilled).
* Overall, the models only seems to predict correct solution for **easy or medium difficult** puzzles, which can be easily solved by simple [scanning techniques](https://www.conceptispuzzles.com/index.aspx?uri=puzzle/sudoku/techniques) and thus does **not guarantee a complete solution** in every case.
* The digit recognition model may not work well with **handwritten digits**, since they were trained on a dataset with non-handwritten digits. 
* If the puzzle image are **highly blurred, distorted or noisy**, the algorithm  may fail to locate the puzzle and/or recognize the digits.
* In the case of conv model, training with runtime **data augmentation** leads to  **slower convergence** rate and **increased training time** .

### Solving Sudoku With Pytesseract And Pysudoku

The easiest way to solve a sudoku puzzle is by using **libraries or API's**. [Py-sudoku](https://pypi.org/project/py-sudoku/) is a python package which can be used to **create or solve** sudoku puzzles with any difficulty levels, using few lines of code.[Py-tesseract](https://pypi.org/project/pytesseract/) is an optical character recognition (OCR) tool for python. It acts as a wrapper for **Google’s Tesseract-OCR Engine** ,and can be used to recognize and “read” the text embedded in images.

**Steps:-**
* Preprocess the input image and remove background
* Crop subregions containing digits from the grid (roi's)
* Predict numbers from image crops using pytesseract (ocr)
* Predict the solution using py-sudoku module
* Plot the resuts on the input image

**Sample Code:-**
```
# Perform ocr on a single character in a cell roi
ocr_result=pytesseract.image_to_string(roi, config='--psm 10 --oem 0  -c tessedit_char_whitelist=123456789')

.........................................
.........................................

# Solve the sudoku puzzle using py-sudoku
puzzle = Sudoku(3, 3, board=sudoku_numbers.tolist())
print(puzzle)

result = puzzle.solve()
result.show_full()
```

### Sudoku Solving Techniques

We can also solve sudoku **without using neural networks**. In fact, some of these methods have considerable advantages over neural networks for solving sudoku puzzles. None of these methods require training and most of them guarantees a complete solution; even if it takes longer time to find the solution. 

* Backtracking (brute force)
* Dancing Links (exact cover)
* Genetic Algorithm (stochastic search)
* Constraint Propagation and Search (peter norvig)
* Sudoku Solving Strategies (explicit rules)

Also, there are somne **advanced techniques** for solving sudoku using neural networks. These methods use a **different network structure or learning mechnanisms** for training the neural networks.

* Recurrent Relational Networks
* Reinforcement Learning With Look-Ahead Search
